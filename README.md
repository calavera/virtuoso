# Virtuoso

Virtuoso is a Ruby library that provides dead simple virtual machine
management across many hypervisors, using the powerful [libvirt](http://libvirt.org)
library underneath. Libvirt is an extremely powerful library, and the
focus of Virtuoso is to provide an extremely simple, common API for
managing virtual machines at the cost of sacrificing some of libvirt's
power.
